# NBA-All-Time-Playoff-Leading-Scorers

## Playoff Points Leaders.ipynb
Using Python, Pandas, and the NBA API to create an interactive scatter plot in Jupyter notebooks looking at the greatest scorers in NBA playoff history!

Because of the Jupyter magic command %matplotlib notebook, **our graph is interactive within Jupyter**.  This allows us to zoom in on various subsections of the graph and better view points that are really grouped together.

Because of our final lambda function, **we are able to view the name of the player who corresponds to a specific point on the graph when we hover our mouse over it**.  Of course, on here it is just a still picture, but I hovered over the name of the top scorer, LeBron James, so it could be seen.

## Playoff Leaders with Excel file.ipynb
I added this Jupyter notebook as well as the relevant Excel file ('Playoff DataFrame.xlsx') so that it could be downloaded and ran so that the user could see firsthand the interactive scatter plot and make use of the mplcursors 'hover' feature.


Enjoy!
