# NBA-All-Time-Playoff-Leading-Scorers

# Playoff Points Leaders.ipynb
Using Python, Pandas, and the NBA API to create an interactive scatter plot in Jupyter notebooks looking at the greatest scorers in NBA playoff history!

Because of the Jupyter magic command %matplotlib notebook, **our graph is interactive within Jupyter**.  This allows us to zoom in on various subsections of the graph and better view points that are really grouped together.

We also use an mplcursors function which allows us to simply **hover over a point on the graph and learn the name of that player, their rank on the all-time NBA Playoff scoring list, and their total number of playoff points**.

## Playoff Leaders with Excel file.ipynb
The same code as above, but instead of making ~5000k API calls we just upload the Excel file ('Playoff DataFrame.xlsx') into a DataFrame and graph it from there.  You can use this code, and that Excel file, to try it for yourself.

Enjoy!
