# NBA-All-Time-Playoff-Leading-Scorers

## Playoff Points Leaders.ipynb
Using Python, Pandas, and the NBA API to create an interactive scatter plot in Jupyter notebooks looking at the greatest scorers in NBA playoff history!

Because of the Jupyter magic command %matplotlib notebook, **our graph is interactive within Jupyter**.  This allows us to zoom in on various subsections of the graph and better view points that are really grouped together.

Using mplcursors, **we are able to view the name of the player who corresponds to a specific point on the graph when we hover our mouse over it**.

## Playoff Leaders with Excel file.ipynb
Of course, we don't want to have to run the original code and make ~5k API calls whenever we want to edit the graph or update the data.  I added this sheet, and the **relevant Excel file (Playoff DataFrame.xlsx)** so that it would be easy to update the settings and style of our graph as well as make changes to the data (for current players still adding to their totals).
While doing this, I also made edits to the cursor feature, so that now instead of just showing a players name, it also shows their scoring rank and total playoff points.

Enjoy!
